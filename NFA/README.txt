this is a data representation of a Non-Deterministic Finite Automata. Please message me with any questions (Paul.Cardoos001@umb.edu). nfa-union will take two xml files that represent valid transition tables for two NFAs parses it out and then unionizes them. nfa.py takes any file that has a representation of an NFA and will spit out all strings that are in that language based on the given alphabet.  You can use the makefile to run my code.
